scripts
=======

A collection of shell scripts I've written to automate and simplify common maintenance and security tasks in Linux, OS X and Amazon Web Services.

- **linux** folder contains scripts that are meant to be run on a Linux server

- **osx** folder contains scripts that are meant to be run from your local OS X machine

- **osx/aws** folder contains scripts that are for working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)
