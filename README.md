scripts
=======

A collection of shell scripts I've written to automate and simplify common maintenance and security tasks in Linux, OS X and Amazon Web Services.

- **aws** Scripts for working with Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- **linux** Scripts that are meant to be run on a Linux server

- **osx** Scripts that are meant to be run from your local OS X machine

- **osx/git** Place these files in your OS X home folder (~/) for advanced git functions
